# Google's foobar challenge

In the one moment, google suggested to sole some funny tasks about Lambchop doomsday!
I devote some time for it and soled 4 levels (out of 7). It was interesting and exciting. I tried to use only my skills,
but after I check stackoverflow for the interesting ideas. For example, I found very pretty solution for the 3.1 task.

Maybe, I will have some time, for proceeding of this challenge.
